# Global Writing Rules

These rules apply to all content generation across all clients. They should be referenced alongside client-specific parameters.

## Agent Rules for Content Generation

### Pre-Generation Checklist
1. Before writing anything, check this rules document
2. For each type of content requested, look up the formatting and style rules for that type of post
3. DO NOT DELETE OR MOVE ANY FILES
4. NEVER reference content from other clients - maintain strict client isolation

## Core Content Principles

### 1. Platform-Specific Formatting
- **Twitter/X**: 280 character limit, engaging hooks, thread-friendly
- **LinkedIn**: Professional tone, longer-form acceptable, industry insights
- **Email**: Subject line + body, clear CTAs, personal tone
- **Newsletter**: Value-driven, structured sections, actionable content

### 2. Universal Writing Guidelines
- Lead with value, not ego
- Use active voice over passive voice
- Write conversationally, not academically  
- Include specific examples and data points when possible
- Always include a clear call-to-action when appropriate

### 3. Content Quality Standards
- Hook readers within the first sentence
- Deliver on the promise made in the hook
- End with clear next steps or calls-to-action
- Proofread for clarity, grammar, and flow

### 4. AI Detection Prevention - CRITICAL RULES

**NEVER use these formulaic AI patterns that immediately reveal machine-generated content:**

#### 🚫 Forbidden Contrast Formats:
- ❌ "This isn't about X—it's about Y" 
- ❌ "This isn't about X; it's about Y"
- ❌ "It's not X, it's Y" / "It's not about X, it's about Y"
- ❌ "It wasn't X, it was Y"
- ❌ "These X haven't made Y more Z—they've made it W"
- ❌ "The problem isn't X—it's Y"
- ❌ "The issue isn't X, it's Y"

#### 🚫 Forbidden Robotic Transitions:
- ❌ "Here's the thing:"
- ❌ "The reality is this:"
- ❌ "At the end of the day,"
- ❌ "The bottom line is:"
- ❌ "When all is said and done,"
- ❌ "The truth is,"
- ❌ "Let me be clear:"

#### 🚫 Forbidden AI Crutch Phrases:
- ❌ "Let's dive deep into..."
- ❌ "Let's unpack this..."
- ❌ "Here's what you need to know:"
- ❌ "The key takeaway is..."
- ❌ "In today's digital landscape..."
- ❌ "In an ever-evolving world..."
- ❌ "In this day and age..."
- ❌ "Moving forward,"

#### 🚫 Forbidden Generic List Introductions:
- ❌ "Here are X ways to..."
- ❌ "Let me share X strategies..."
- ❌ "I'm going to break down X methods..."
- ❌ "Below are X tips to..."

#### ✅ Use Natural Alternatives Instead:
- **Start directly** with the actual point
- **Write conversationally** like talking to a friend
- **Use specific examples** and concrete scenarios
- **Vary sentence structure** and length naturally
- **Let personality shine through** with authentic voice
- **Jump straight into value** without robotic setups

#### 🔍 Final AI Detection Test:
Before publishing, ask: "Would a human naturally say this exact phrase?" If it sounds like every other AI-generated article, rewrite it completely.

### 5. Ethical Boundaries
- Never fabricate data or testimonials (use web search when inserting research)
- Always disclose affiliations or sponsored content
- Respect intellectual property and attribution
- Maintain professional standards across all content

## Reference Hierarchy

When generating content, follow this reference order:

1. **Global Rules** (this file) - Universal principles
2. **Client-Specific Parameters** - Located in `clients/[client]/parameters/`
   - `client-style-guide.md` - Client's unique voice and style
   - `misc-context.md` - Client-specific context and background
   - `output-doc.md` - Reference outputs and examples
3. **Previous Content** - Same client's previous day content only
   - `clients/[current-client]/[previous-date]/`
   - Use for consistency and progression, not for copying
4. **Agent Rules** - Technical instructions for AI agents

## Cross-Client Contamination Prevention

**NEVER reference content, style, or parameters from other clients.**

Each client folder should be treated as an isolated environment:
- Only reference files within the same client's directory
- Use global rules for universal principles
- Keep client voice and style completely separate

## Content Quality
- Always deliver complete, polished drafts
- Include CTAs when specified by content format or platform
- Match the requested format and platform requirements
- Maintain the client's unique voice and style

## Error Prevention
- If client parameters don't exist, use global rules only
- If previous day content doesn't exist, proceed without historical reference
- Never fabricate missing information or cross-reference other clients 

## Content Generation Process

1. Read global writing rules (this file)
2. Load client-specific parameters from their `/parameters/` folder
3. Review previous day's content from same client only
4. Generate content following client's unique style
5. Apply global quality standards for final review
6. **FINAL CHECK: Scan for any AI detection patterns and eliminate them** # Global Writing Rules
