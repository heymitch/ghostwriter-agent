Please add the following checks to the writing process; note - many of these apply to fiction writing; however they are also relevant to non-fiction writing. Do not take these as gospel, but use them as a guide - a single or even few violations are not a problem, but if there are many, then the writing should be flagged and revised:

**Common AI Word Patterns**

**Overused Adverbs**
angrily, anxiously, barely above a whisper, carefully, cautiously, coldly, completely, coolly, coyly, deliberately, dreamily, eagerly, ever so slightly, fervently, gently, happily, helplessly, hesitantly, hungrily, inexorably, intensely, knowingly, languidly, lazily, lightly, longingly, loosely, needily, nervously, passionately, perfectly, precisely, purposely, quickly, really, reluctantly, sadly, seductively, sharply, shyly, slightly, slowly, slyly, smugly, softly, suddenly, suggestively, sweetly, teasingly, tenderly, tightly, truly, utterly, very, warily, warmly, wickedly, wistfully

**Scene-Setting and Emotional Clich√©s**
AI writing often relies on predictable atmospheric shortcuts. Weather becomes mood shorthand ("rain pattered against the window, mirroring her melancholy"), while physical reactions to emotions follow rigid patterns. Instead of "his jaw clenched" for anger or "her heart raced" for nervousness, consider how your specific character would actually respond to stress.

**Dialogue tags**
Dialogue tags present another common pitfall. AI tends toward overly dramatic alternatives to "said" or redundant emotion tags that repeat what the dialogue already conveys. The strongest dialogue usually relies on simple tags or none at all when the speaker is clear.

**Genre-Specific Patterns**
Science fiction writing shows predictable AI patterns. Instead of "lights flickered ominously" or "with machine precision," develop specific details that serve your unique story. Generic phrases like "the hum of machinery" or "sterile white corridors" create atmosphere but don't advance plot or character development.
