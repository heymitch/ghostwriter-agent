# Service-Based Lead Magnet Generator

## Purpose
Create high-value "service-based lead magnets" that demonstrate your expertise by analyzing a prospect's existing content and generating 3 tailored LinkedIn thought leadership posts they can immediately use. This strategy proves your competence while providing genuine value, making prospects more likely to engage with your services.

## Input Methods
The agent should accept any of these inputs to research the prospect:
1. **Name only** - "Generate lead magnet for [John Smith]"
2. **LinkedIn profile URL** - Paste the LinkedIn profile link
3. **Website URL** - Company or personal website
4. **Existing content** - Direct paste of their LinkedIn posts, blog articles, or other content

## Research Process
Before generating content:
1. **Analyze their current content strategy** - What topics do they cover? What's their voice/tone?
2. **Identify content gaps** - What important topics are they missing?
3. **Study their audience engagement** - Which posts perform well? What resonates?
4. **Research their industry trends** - Current challenges, emerging opportunities
5. **Find their unique positioning** - What makes them different in their space?

## Three Pillars of Thought Leadership Framework

### Pillar 1: Plant a Flag (Tell the Truth)
**Concept**: Pick a stance and defend it confidently
- Choose between competing approaches (speed vs quality, growth vs profitability, etc.)
- Take a position that creates healthy debate
- Avoid fence-sitting or "it depends" content
- Base the stance on industry research and trends

**LinkedIn Post Structure**:
- Strong declarative opening statement
- 2-3 supporting points with evidence
- Real-world example or scenario
- Clear position statement ending

### Pillar 2: Prove Competence (Show Results)
**Concept**: Demonstrate expertise through concrete evidence
- Share case studies (can be anonymized: "SaaS client" vs naming them)
- Present before/after scenarios
- Document processes and methodologies
- Show measurable outcomes and results

**LinkedIn Post Structure**:
- Hook with a specific result or outcome
- Brief context/challenge description
- Step-by-step process or strategy used
- Quantified results and key takeaways

### Pillar 3: Predict the Future (Industry Intelligence)
**Concept**: Share research-based predictions about industry direction
- Analyze emerging trends and their implications
- Predict market shifts based on current data
- Identify opportunities others are missing
- Connect dots between seemingly unrelated industry changes

**LinkedIn Post Structure**:
- Bold prediction or trend statement
- Supporting data/research citations
- Current examples proving the trend
- Actionable advice for adapting

## Content Generation Requirements

### Research Standards
- **No speculation** - All predictions must be backed by research, data, or current market evidence
- **Industry-specific** - Content must be relevant to prospect's specific niche/industry
- **Actionable** - Each post should provide concrete next steps or insights

### LinkedIn Formatting Requirements
**CRITICAL**: Each LinkedIn post MUST follow ALL formatting rules from `-writing-rules/linkedin-rules.mdc`

**Character Limit**: Posts must stay under 2,800 characters (non-negotiable)

**Required LinkedIn Structure**:
1. **First 200 Characters**: Must be a hook with cliffhanger (Strong declarative statement, thought-provoking question, controversial opinion, unique stat, or meaningful moment)
2. **Introduction (200-400 chars)**: 4-block structure - Hook → Promise → Solution → Transition
3. **Content Style**: Must use one of 5 approved styles: Steps, Stats, Mistakes, Lessons, or Examples
4. **Headers**: Use numbered format (1/, 2/, 3/ or Step 1:, Step 2:, etc.) written in sentence style
5. **Alternating Format**: MUST alternate between bulleted lists and paragraph style across sections
6. **Section Structure**: What (declarative line) → How (3-5 tactical points) → Why (insight/benefit)
