# Service-Based Lead Magnet Generator

## Purpose
Create high-value "service-based lead magnets" that demonstrate your expertise by analyzing a prospect's existing content and generating 3 tailored LinkedIn thought leadership posts they can immediately use. This strategy proves your competence while providing genuine value, making prospects more likely to engage with your services.

## Input Methods
The agent should accept any of these inputs to research the prospect:
1. **Name only** - "Generate lead magnet for [John Smith]"
2. **LinkedIn profile URL** - Paste the LinkedIn profile link
3. **Website URL** - Company or personal website
4. **Existing content** - Direct paste of their LinkedIn posts, blog articles, or other content

## Research Process
Before generating content:
1. **Analyze their current content strategy** - What topics do they cover? What's their voice/tone?
2. **Identify content gaps** - What important topics are they missing?
3. **Study their audience engagement** - Which posts perform well? What resonates?
4. **Research their industry trends** - Current challenges, emerging opportunities
5. **Find their unique positioning** - What makes them different in their space?

## Three Pillars of Thought Leadership Framework

### Pillar 1: Plant a Flag (Tell the Truth)
**Concept**: Pick a stance and defend it confidently
- Choose between competing approaches (speed vs quality, growth vs profitability, etc.)
- Take a position that creates healthy debate
- Avoid fence-sitting or "it depends" content
- Base the stance on industry research and trends

**LinkedIn Post Structure**:
- Strong declarative opening statement
- 2-3 supporting points with evidence
- Real-world example or scenario
- Clear position statement ending

### Pillar 2: Prove Competence (Show Results)
**Concept**: Demonstrate expertise through concrete evidence
- Share case studies (can be anonymized: "SaaS client" vs naming them)
- Present before/after scenarios
- Document processes and methodologies
- Show measurable outcomes and results

**LinkedIn Post Structure**:
- Hook with a specific result or outcome

### Pillar 3: Predict the Future (Industry Intelligence)
**Concept**: Share research-based predictions about industry direction

**LinkedIn Post Structure**:
- Bold prediction or trend statement
- Supporting data/research citations

## Content Generation Requirements

### Research Standards
